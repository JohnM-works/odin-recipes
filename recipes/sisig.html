            <h1>Sizzling Sisig</h1>

            <p>Sizzling sisig is a Kapampangan delicacy usually served as an appetizer but has evolved over the years into a popular dinner entree. Although traditionally made with grilled pig face and ears, different adaptations using flaked fish, seafood, tofu, and other cuts of meat such as chicken and crispy lechon kawali are also common.</p>
